# Community Traits Ported (OpenMW)

Select your character's past that will shape his future. Almost 300 traits across 4 types to choose from!

This is an effort to port some community-made traits based on [Merlord's Character Backgrounds](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46795) or MTR's mods to OpenMW based on Character Traits Framework.

### My Personal Changes

They are reduced to a minimum and either are aimed at better balancing or dictated by engine limitations / my unwillingness to abuse the API.

<details>
<summary>Click me!</summary>

**Merlord's Character Backgrounds > Artificer**

> +50 Enchant -> +20 Enchant

Even though disabled spells is quite a heavy hindrance, at high levels Enchant becomes objectively more powerful than any school of magic due to charge discount.

**Merlord's Character Backgrounds > Framed**

> Initial bounty delay: 1 hour -> 1-24 hours

Initial bounty delay was increased and randomized to both give player more wiggle room at the start and make it more sudden (at default 30 timescale, 1 in-game day = 48 irl minutes).

> Bounty interval: 1-4 days -> 2-6 days

Merlord in his version skips adding bounty if the player is in combat at the time of checking. While this can be implemented in OpenMW in a roundabout way, I figured it would be easier to just pump the numbers up a bit and not jump through the multiple hoops for this inconsequential change.

**Merlord's Character Backgrounds > Blood of the Dremora**  
**Merlord's Character Backgrounds > Escaped Slave**  
**Merlord's Character Backgrounds > Famed Warrior**

> Scripted enemies will spawn randomly behind the player instead of as sleep encounters.

I have multiple reasons for this change:

- OpenMW Lua API doesn't have any way to **reliably** check if player is sleeping. If the logic for it is dependent on `Auto-save when Rest` setting specifically being ON, I would prefer to avoid that entirely
- While the "kill the target when it expects the least" reasoning can be far-fetched for random animals or assasin organization, it doesn't sit right for me in terms of slavers, rivals and daedra
- I like it being more unexpected. Fight me

And besides, limit on their spawn frequency is still the same.

**Merlord's Character Backgrounds > Blood of the Dremora**

> Magic skills raised by killing a dremora don't conribute to your level progress.

It's actually the same as in Merlord's mod, but I figured I should mention it just in case. Yes, this is intentional, because otherwise you could get up to 8 major/minor skill ups for free every other level just by picking the right class.

**Merlord's Character Backgrounds > Escaped Slave**  
**MTR's Lineages > Khajiit**

> Added Tamriel_Data khajiit races to the trait requirements whitelist.

Self-explanatory, I presume?

**Merlord's Character Backgrounds > Rat King**

> Unchanged

It's perfect as it is.

**The Wretched and the Weird > Drunkard**

> Drain fatigue ability -> max fatigue reduction

Drain fatigue affects current fatigue and not max, thus it gets healed in a few seconds back.

> Duration of the withdrawal: 6 real life hours -> 7.5 in-game days

Since I like to leave the game running while I'm AFK, I translated real life time checks into in-game. At default settings they should be the same, but if you play with slower flow of time, you might want to reduce this setting. Or not. I certainly won't.

> Any potions are alcoholic -> only beverages are alcoholic

While I can imagine alchemists making their tinctures alcoholic-based, it doesn't make much sense gameplay-wise when you already constantly drinking potions.

**The Wretched and the Weird > Nudist**

> +75 Unarmored -> +30 Unarmored

Starting with ~50-70 armor right off the bat is not a good balancing in my book.

**The Wretched and the Weird > Wretch**

> Abilities are treated as modifiers, making birthsigns actually affect your final stats

In short, it's for mod compatibility.

Base game treats fortify stat abilities as base stat increases instead of modifiers (light numbers). This causes issues with mods which apply them dynamically. Take, for example, [Sun's Dusk](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/57526): it gives you needs buffs and debuffs straight away, way before the trait has been picked. And when you pick Wretch at full needs, you suddenly get negative base stats when the buffs wear off. I assume now you see the issue.

As a side effect it slightly buffs the background as a whole by un-invalidates your birthsign choice, but I'd say a net positive for the player agency and more natural for the logic of the game systems. Perhaps it even makes your birthsing choice harder by making many more of them way more impactful in the long run.
